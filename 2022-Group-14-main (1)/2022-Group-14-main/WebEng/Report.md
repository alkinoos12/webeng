Introduction:
</center>

The task was to create a website that would be a song service giving you access to over a 100000 real world songs and artists that came from a keggle dataset.For that we had to implement a various amount of endpoints in order to be able to first retrieve the songs but furthermore, be able to manipulate them in ways such as updating names or even creating and deleting artists/songs.

Important decisions:
</center>
Since we did not have any prior knowledge of web engineering it would be a challenge to create a website when picking any language and any database management system therefore we were open to any combination of these.While researching we came across the mern stack quite often and decided to challenge ourselves with that.

##Database:
The M in Mern stack means using mongodb as our database management system handling the creation of the database and furthermore using mongoose we would be able to handle the database/collection by updating songs/artists, creating or deleting them in our mongodb atlas which is our online database in mongodb.
 
##Back end:
 Additionally the e and n in MERN are e - express and n- node.js these two come together since node.js is the environment we use in order to be able to use express.These two are mostly(as far as we have seen) used with javascript therefore we did not have many choices when it comes to choosing a language after choosing to implement MERN stack.

##Front end:
 Ultimately the r in MERN is react which is a javascript library that we used for front end as well as AXIOS in order to connect our front end with our back end.

Instructions for the usage of the API:
</center>
We merged REQ1 requirements 2 4(the retrieving) and 5 in one endpoint through queries meaning that with that endpoint you can manipulate the queries in a way where you can achieve the goals of these 3 requirements using only that one end point.In order to retrieve songs by an artist id,popularity,artist name,release year or name.Pick an option on the search by querry(the option that u would want to search by) and then fill the respective queries(for searching by name fill the name query,etc.).

All the other endpoints are in our opinion self explanatory.

Milestones overview:
</center>
#Milestone 1 was pretty straight forward and we did not have any problems apart from the text/csv support which we struggled the most since we did not know how this was meant to be implemented and could not find a lot of resources about it online either.Other than that milestone 1 went pretty smooth.

<br>

##Learnings:With milestone one we learned how to create an API which was a pretty interesting experience since we did not know what an API even is when starting this course.Additionally it helped as with planning since we had to divide all the requirements to an end point. 

#Milestone 2 was challenging since it was in the holidays and we had a big learning curve because we have never  done anything even similar to the back end of a website before. Therefore there was a lot of research done for it.The most challenging part was debugging and choosing the correct way that worked for us to implement the back end since most of what we had found would not work for us.

<br>
##Learnings:
Milestone 2 enabled us to first of all learn a new language,javaScript.Additionally it helped us understand more about how a website works behind the scenes, with the connections in outsource databases(in our example mongodb).Ultimately it helped us have a better understanding of routing and http requests since we had to implement those ourselves.

<br>
#Ultimately Milestone 3 was as challenging as m2 for the same reasons as well as the exams being close by.The hardest part was trying to connect the back end with the front end through our API.This procedure created a lot of bugs that we had to fix and took a lot of time.Additionally after we got the hang of it it went pretty smoothly and we decided to focus on making our website(front end) as  presentable as we could.

<br>
##Learnings:
In this milestone we learned how the connection between front end and back end works when we navigate through a website which was interesting to say the least since we have been doing that for ages without knowing what happens behind 
the scenes.Additionally it enabled us to get creative when creating the front end and make it as friendly as we could for the client(person navigating through our website).

<br>
#DISTRIBUTION OF WORK:

The distribution of work went pretty smoothly and we managed to fairly give each one of us the same amount of work to do for each part and we all contributed equally for every part/milestone and had no conflicts between us when doing so.
